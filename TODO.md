- [ ] (HIGH PRIORITY) Loading of saved graphs
- [ ] (MEDIUM/HIGH PRIORITY) Add more essential nodes (see incomplete* list below)
- [ ] (HIGH PRIORITY) Compile generated code and give errors
- [ ] (HIGH PRIORITY) Write generated code to file if no errors and trigger a Unity Reimport
        - AssetDatabase.Refresh - For all files (http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetDatabase.Refresh.html)
        - AssetDatabase.ImportAsset - For specific file (http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/AssetDatabase.ImportAsset.html)
- [ ] (LOW PRIORITY) Embed node GUIDs in generated code in order to provide error feedback directly on nodes. This can also be used to provide runtime error feedback, not just compile-time
- [ ] (LOW PRIORITY) Add sticky notes / comments
- [ ] (HIGH PRIORITY) Add create node menu (and title attribute to populate create node menu) (leech off of GTLogicGraph; it had a really nice implementation)

**Essential nodes (the incomplete list)**
- (HIGH PRIORITY) Math nodes (most important)
- (HIGH PRIORITY) Vector2 node
- (HIGH PRIORITY) Vector2 and Vector3 member nodes
- (VERY HIGH PRIORITY) Basic C# and Unity types start nodes (i.e. value nodes)
- (HIGH PRIORITY) Transform nodes (position, scale, rotation)
- (VERY LOW PRIORITY) GetComponent node (w/ dynamic enum generation for component types)
- (HIGH PRIORITY) GetComponent node (just string input for component type and trust user ;) )
- (MEDIUM PRIORITY) Camera nodes
- (HIGH PRIORITY) Properties (One node for creating properties, one node for accessing)
- (MEDIUM PRIORITY) Variables (One node for creating variables, one node for accessing)
- (VERY HIGH PRIORITY) Assign node
- (VERY HIGH PRIORITY) Function node (without params or return values): basically use an event node for defining a function, simple end node (with text input for method name) for calling
