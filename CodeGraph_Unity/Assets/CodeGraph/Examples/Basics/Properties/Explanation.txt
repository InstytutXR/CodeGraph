This example showcases how to use the Create Property
and Get Property nodes.
With the Create Property node you specify the type and name
of the property. This automatically adds a public variable to
the generated code. Properties are fields you can access through
the inspector inside the Unity Editor.
With the Get Property node you can access the property and use it
in various ways. In this example it is used to print the text
"Your speed is: <Speed>" where <Speed> is the value of the property
created previously.
